# AI-Powered Optimizing Compiler for Real-Time Medical Image Analysis
This project focuses on developing an AI-powered optimizing compiler designed for real-time medical image analysis, specifically for MRI and CT scans. The compiler leverages a hybrid of Genetic Algorithm (GA) and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) to enhance compilation speed, optimize deep learning models, and accelerate medical image segmentation, classification, and anomaly detection.

## Key Features
✅ Hybrid GA + PSO Optimization

GA searches for the best hyperparameters.

PSO fine-tunes model weights for faster convergence.

✅ Efficient Model Compilation & Deployment

Supports TensorFlow, PyTorch, ONNX, OpenVINO, and TensorRT.

Applies quantization, pruning, and fusion to optimize deep learning models.

✅ Real-Time Medical Image Processing

Supports DICOM format for MRI/CT scans.

Reduces inference time while maintaining diagnostic accuracy.

✅ Cloud & Edge Compatibility

Optimized for GPUs, TPUs, and edge devices (e.g., NVIDIA Jetson, Intel Movidius).

## Implementation Steps
1️⃣ Data Collection & Preprocessing

Collect MRI and CT scans from public datasets (e.g., NIH, BraTS, RSNA).

Apply data augmentation for better generalization.

2️⃣ AI Model Development

Train deep learning models (U-Net, ResNet, Vision Transformers) for tumor segmentation & anomaly detection.

Optimize models using quantization & pruning.

3️⃣ Compiler Development & Optimization

GA Optimization finds the best hyperparameters (e.g., learning rate, batch size).

PSO Optimization reduces redundant computations and fine-tunes model weights.

Convert models to ONNX, OpenVINO, or TensorRT for deployment.

4️⃣ Real-Time Testing & Validation

Deploy on cloud (AWS, Google Cloud, Azure) or edge devices.

Evaluate performance on real-world medical datasets.

This AI-powered compiler enhances real-time medical imaging workflows, making MRI and CT scan analysis faster, more efficient, and deployment-ready for hospitals and research labs.
